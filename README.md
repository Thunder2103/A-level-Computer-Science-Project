# A-level-Computer-Science-Project

My A-Level computer science project. 
As mandated by the OCR exam board.

The following files include:
the code developed for the project,
the project write-up.

The write-up is what was actually graded. I am uncertain of the grade attained for this. 
I will update this when/if I am aware of my grade 

I hope this helps anyone studying the course. 
Good luck. You've got this.
